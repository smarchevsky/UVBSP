# UVBSP
Binary split partitioning of UV.

You can split UV texture islands. Shader code generator will be available later.

Now you can draw awesome images splitting UV, and screenshot them, because no image export supported.

ToDo:
- Shader generator (glsl/hlsl) with static binary tree.
- Ctrl-Z (!).
- Save/Load.
- Figure out, why window is so laggy on drag.
- Windows support.
- Add ImGUI UI or something.

Dependencies:
- SFML
